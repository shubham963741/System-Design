üõ°Ô∏è Reliability in System Design

Reliability is the ability of a system to consistently perform its intended function without failure, within expected conditions and timeframes.
In essence ‚Äî a reliable system keeps running correctly, even when things go wrong.

‚öñÔ∏è Key Principles of Reliability
Principle	Description
Fault Tolerance	The ability to continue operating despite component failures.
Redundancy	Having backup components or services ready to take over.
Failover	Automatic switch to a standby system when the primary fails.
Graceful Degradation	System continues operating with reduced functionality under failure.
Resilience	System‚Äôs ability to recover quickly from disruptions.
üß© Core Components of Reliable Systems
Component	Strategy	Tools/Examples
Replication	Duplicate data/services across instances or regions	PostgreSQL replicas, Cassandra, S3 replication
Health Checks	Detect and replace unhealthy components	Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes
Load Balancing	Divert traffic away from failing nodes	Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ELB
Monitoring & Alerting	Detect and respond to anomalies	Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager
Distributed Consensus	Ensure consistency among nodes	Raft, Paxos, etcd, Zookeeper
Disaster Recovery	Maintain backups and restore workflows	Velero, AWS Backup, Cross-region replication
‚öôÔ∏è Reliability Patterns
1. Replication Pattern

Maintain multiple copies of data or services to ensure availability and quick recovery from node or disk failures.

2. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Prevent cascading failures by detecting failing dependencies and temporarily halting requests to them.

3. Retry with Exponential Backoff

Automatically retry failed operations with increasing delay intervals to reduce load on struggling services.

4. Bulkhead Isolation

Isolate components or services so that a failure in one area does not affect others.

5. Graceful Degradation

When failures occur, the system continues to provide a limited experience instead of a total outage (e.g., static pages instead of dynamic content).

üìä Reliability Metrics (SLIs, SLOs, SLAs)
Metric	Description	Typical Target
Availability (Uptime)	% of time the system is operational	99.9% ‚Üí 99.999%
MTBF	Mean Time Between Failures	Higher is better
MTTR	Mean Time To Repair/Recover	Lower is better
Error Rate	% of failed requests	< 0.1% ideally
SLO Compliance	How often you meet your Service Level Objectives	99%+ recommended
üß† Design Practices for Reliability

‚úÖ Use redundant infrastructure components (active-active or active-passive).

‚úÖ Deploy across multiple availability zones or regions.

‚úÖ Maintain immutable infrastructure for predictable rollbacks.

‚úÖ Implement automated backups and tested restore procedures.

‚úÖ Use graceful shutdown hooks in containers and services.

‚úÖ Ensure observability (metrics, logs, traces) for fast incident response.

‚úÖ Conduct chaos engineering to proactively test fault tolerance.

üí• Common Causes of Unreliability

Single Points of Failure (SPOF)

Unhandled exceptions or dependency failures

Inconsistent configuration or version drift

Insufficient monitoring or alerting

Lack of tested failover and recovery procedures
